          <h2>Homeownership - The Leading Wealth Creator for the American Working Class</h2>

          <p class="lead">Pull readers into your data story with a compelling introduction. Notice how this paragraph appears in a larger font than others, because the HTML code begins with a "lead" class.</p>

          <p>The American dream rests on the idea that low income and working class families have the opportunity to climb the economic ladder to success. Homeownership provides a stable stepping stone for families to turn that dream into a reality. If one were to examine two working class families, one that chose the rental option and one that chose ownership, their generation of wealth would be vastly different. 
Let's travel back to the year 1995 to compare two working-class families in Hartford. One family rents a two-bedroom apartment that initially costs $450 per month but increases with inflation. A second family buys a home and makes mortgage payments that remain stable at $550 per month. Fast-forward 30 years later to 2025 and the homeowner has created wealth due to the equity in their home and also from tax benefits that they accrued due to mortgage deductions.  
Community Land Trusts (CLTS), aim to aid people in entering and participating in this market through maintaining affordability, allowing them to generate wealth by growing their ownership over time. Community Land Trusts are nonprofits that purchase land and lease it back at a nominal rate. These trusts allow low to moderate income families to enter the market by buying the house while the land is owned by the CLT.</p>

          <h2>Does USA Help Families Generate Wealth?</h2>

          <!-- Map 1 -->
          <p>First, let’s get a concrete look at these houses in southern Hartford, and get an idea of their current market values. The map below separates the higher value homes and lower value homes, and centers on mean value homes. The more pronounced reds and oranges indicate the houses we are especially interested in studying, as they lie close to the median price of the south Hartford USA homes.
          </p>

          <iframe title="Zillow South Hartford Estimated Home Value" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-P9mvl" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/P9mvl/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="568" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Map 1: Geographic location of USA homes in southern Hartford and their current values. Explore the map <a href=https://www.datawrapper.de/_/P9mvl/?v=5>here</a>.</p>


          <!-- Chart 1 -->
          <p>The data regarding the value of single family USA homes in south Hartford tells us that a lot about home values. Over 85% of the USA homes in south Hartford fall within a range of $66,000, and the median falls right in the middle of this range. The histogram below in Chart 1 shows the distribution of home prices in Hartford. The results of this chart are encouraging, as it shows that many homes exist within the two buckets covering a range of $200k to $266k, and the median as referenced above sits at $233k, neatly in the middle of this range. This means data we find about median households within the is very likely to be applicable to much of the sample size, and more meaningful conclusions can be made.
          </p>

          <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQG34BgrZN3B5jZ1GnslCWu1YFeFUkMHbNem2PtbHT5ONINUKohv4iW60K0GrDSQUKz8mbAu84tHm4i/pubchart?oid=1282448290&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

          <p>Chart 1: USA Home prices in South Hartford are very consistent, and mostly fall very close to the median.</p>


          <!-- Chart 2 -->
          <p>To put these homes into the context of the USA program itself, we need to estimate what the Allowable USA resale price for each of these homes would look like. However, this calculation relies on historical data that is not available for all the homes, so the dataset is smaller here. This is because calculating the allowable USA resale price requires the original purchase price of the home. From the sample of 41 homes in Chart 1, 30±2 year sale data was only available for 19. More details on this can be found in the methodology section.
          </p>

          <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQG34BgrZN3B5jZ1GnslCWu1YFeFUkMHbNem2PtbHT5ONINUKohv4iW60K0GrDSQUKz8mbAu84tHm4i/pubchart?oid=881177479&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

          <p>Chart 2: The consistencies seen in Chart 1 are present here with USA resale prices, where 17 out of 19 resale values fall between $130,000 and $210,000.
          </p>


          <!-- Figure 1 -->
          <p>We next need to look into whether or not owners of these homes are gaining wealth over time. To do this we mapped the data to show houses that showed the gains or losses a family might have made after fully paying off a 30 year mortgage with adjusted USA sale prices and allowable resale values. Below are two example homes from our sample in Chart 2: H2 and H35. H2’s sale price 30 years ago was $38,900. With some help from Zillow’s mortgage calculator, we estimated that over the course of a 30 year mortgage, this homeowner would have invested $134,640 into the home. The estimated current USA resale price for this home is $147,980. This means that if the owner sells the house right now, they would make $147,980 - $134,640 = $13,340 in additional profit. This homeowner would make 9.91% more than they invested. Over 30 years, this house has made them money.</p>

          <img src="images/H2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <!-- Figure 2 -->
          <p>Now let’s look at H35. The 1995 sale price was $80,000 and the estimated 30 year mortgage payments amount to $238,320. The estimated allowable USA resale price for this home is $169,080. This means that if sold now, the owner would make back $69,240 less than what they invested into the home, or a -29.05% return on investment. Over the 30 years of mortgage payments, the owner has gained complete ownership of the house, but will have to wait many more years before the house price appreciates enough for them to break even on the money they spent on the mortgage.
          </p>

          <img src="images/H35.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">


          <!-- Map 2 -->
          <p>Let’s now apply this concept to the rest of the houses in the sample from Chart 2. In the map below the red arrows indicate a house that has invested more into the house than they can sell it for - like H35 - and the green arrows indicate houses that are more valuable than the 30 year mortgage investment - like H2. The results of this map tell us that the estimated investment put into that house; accumulated over a 30 year mortgage with a 20% down payment; generally outweighs the estimated USA resale value of the house. It is important to remember however, that as we have mentioned, homeownership in general is a better option than renting. Even though most of these USA homeowners will lose money if they sell the house immediately after paying off the 30 year mortgage, holding on to the house means they have ownership. This is something that can be passed on generationally and will generally continue to appreciate in value. Rental tenants cannot attain this. 
          </p>

          <iframe title="Estimated Wealth Invested vs. Actual Ownership in USA Homes" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-nTVDd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nTVDd/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="645" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Map 2: After a standard 30 year mortgage is paid off, USA homeowners are far more likely to have invested more money into the home than it is allowed to be resold for, with an average deficit of -17.78%. However, this deficit will decrease over time as each home is likely to appreciate in value over time, making net-positive wealth possible in the extended long-term. A good option for building generational wealth. Explore the map <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/nTVDd/">here</a>.

          <h2>Methodology</h2>

          <h4>How we derived histrocial price data and estimated resale and mortgage values:</h4>

          <p>The 1995 sale prices we found were based on <a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow.com's</a> historical sale price data for each property. Data regarding the USA houses we found was provided to us privately by the <a href="https://cljct.org/">Center for Leadership and Justice</a> in Hartford. To select the 19 houses we studied for 30 year sale data, we expanded the acceptable historical year range to 1993-98 as there were simply too few properties that had sale prices precisely in 1995.
          </p>

          <p>The allowable USA resale prices for each of these homes was calculated using the formula provided by USA on their <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q5iw_4cguwXPOESftpllB0noBcP1XSSF/view">resale procedure document</a>. The formula we used is as follows: 
            <p><em>2500(est. Cost of closing) + (current market value x  5.25% [est. agent commission based on national average]) + 500(USA transfer fee) + adjusted sales price = allowable USA resale price</em></p>
            More details about this formula can be found on the document itself. It is important to note that we omitted capital improvements in this calculation, which if applied would increase the resale value. Since we do not have access to the personal receipts of any improvements homeowners have made to these houses, our estimated resale prices are quite conservative in nature.
            The estimated monthly mortgage payments for each house was calculated using Zillow’s <a href="https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/">mortgage calculator</a>, using the original 1995 purchase price with a 20% down payment. 
          </p>

          <p>The total equity invested was then calculated using the monthly mortgage payment x 12 months x 30 years.</p>

          <p>The wealth gained percentage was calculated by finding the percentage difference between the estimated investment and the estimated resale price.
          </p>

          <h4>How we found comparable rental data:</h4>

          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>

          <h2>EDIT Section 4 Label: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <img src="screenshots/github-collaborators.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

          <h4>Quicker Edits on your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub and waiting for them to appear online, you can quickly make multiple edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/code-download.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>Install a code editor tool. My favorite free open-source option is the <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev"> open-source Pulsar text editor</a>, but there are many other options.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>
              <img src="screenshots/index-open-with.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>In your code editor, save changes to your "index.html" file, then refresh your browser to instantly view your changes made on your local computer.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/save-edits.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>After editing, upload the contents of "index.html" from your local computer to your online GitHub account, then view your edits the public web.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
